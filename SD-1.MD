Requirements Gathering

Before diving into the technical design, it's crucial to identify the functional and non-functional requirements.
Functional Requirements:
* Shortening URLs: Convert a long URL into a shorter, unique alias.
* Redirection: Redirect users from the short URL to the original URL.
* Analytics (Optional): Track the number of times a short URL has been accessed.
* Custom Aliases (Optional): Allow users to create custom aliases for URLs.

Non-Functional Requirements:
* Scalability: Handle millions of URL requests per day.
* Low Latency: Quick redirection with minimal delay.
* High Availability: Ensure the service is available 24/7.
* Data Integrity: Ensure that shortened URLs map correctly to their original URLs without data loss.
